# Nexara Backend API - cURL Test Commands

This file contains all the cURL commands to test the Nexara backend API, including authentication, project management, and role-based access control.

## üìã Sample Data IDs

After running the seed script, you can use these sample IDs for testing:

- **Project ID**: `sample-project-1`
- **Board IDs**: `sample-board-1`, `sample-board-2`
- **Column IDs**: `col-1`, `col-2`, `col-3`, `col-4`, `col-5`, `col-6`, `col-7`, `col-8`
- **Issue IDs**: `issue-1`, `issue-2`, `issue-3`, `issue-4`, `issue-5`

## üîë Sample Test Flow

1. **Login as Owner**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@nexara.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```

2. **Get projects**:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/projects \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

3. **Get project members**:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/projects/sample-project-1/members \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

4. **Create a new issue**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/issues \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "title": "Test Issue from cURL",
       "description": "Created via cURL command",
       "type": "TASK",
       "priority": "MEDIUM",
       "columnId": "col-1"
     }'
   ```

## üìù Notes

- Replace `YOUR_JWT_TOKEN` with the actual JWT token received from login
- Replace `PROJECT_ID`, `BOARD_ID`, `COLUMN_ID`, `ISSUE_ID`, `MEMBER_ID`, `USER_ID` with actual IDs
- All timestamps in responses are in ISO 8601 format
- Error responses include detailed error messages and field validation errors
- The API returns consistent JSON responses with `success`, `message`, and `data` fields

## üö® Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid/missing token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

Error response format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "fieldName",
      "message": "Validation error message",
      "value": "invalidValue"
    }
  ]
}
```
