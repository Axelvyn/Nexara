## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# At minimum, set:
# - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string)
# - JWT_SECRET (random secret key)
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database (for development)
npm run db:push

# Or run migrations (for production)
npm run db:migrate

# Seed the database with sample data
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Or start production server
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The database includes the following main entities:

- **Users**: User accounts with authentication
- **Projects**: Project containers owned by users
- **ProjectMembers**: Role-based membership relationships
- **Boards**: Kanban boards within projects
- **Columns**: Columns within boards (To Do, In Progress, etc.)
- **Issues**: Tasks/issues with types, priorities, and status

## üîê Role-Based Access Control

The system implements a comprehensive RBAC system with 4 user roles:

- **OWNER**: Full access to everything (project creator)
- **ADMIN**: Can manage project settings, members, and boards
- **DEVELOPER**: Can create/edit issues and move them between columns
- **VIEWER**: Read-only access to project data

See [RBAC.md](./RBAC.md) for detailed documentation on the permission system.

## üîê Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## üìù Sample Data

The seed script creates:

- **Owner**: `test@nexara.com` (password: `password123`)
- **Admin**: `admin@nexara.com` (password: `password123`)
- **Developer**: `dev@nexara.com` (password: `password123`)
- **Viewer**: `viewer@nexara.com` (password: `password123`)
- Sample project with boards and issues
- Project members with different roles for testing RBAC
- Various issue types and priorities for testing

## üö® Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:

- Validation errors with detailed field information
- Authentication and authorization errors
- Database constraint errors
- Custom error messages for different scenarios

## üîí Security Features

- **Helmet**: Security headers
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Request rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt for secure password storage
- **JWT**: Secure token-based authentication

## üìä Monitoring
